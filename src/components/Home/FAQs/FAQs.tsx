        <FAQAccordion question="How do you plan to protect content from copyright infringement?">
          <Typography paragraph>
            Before listing a script on the storybase, a writer is expected to
            fill their story abstract and provide proof of ownership in the form
            of copyright or something equally substantial. We carefully vet
            producers who want to buy scripts by ensuring they have legally
            registered companies as well as other due diligence that falls under
            KYC (Know Your Customer).
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            They (the producers) only have access to the script loglines and a
            little information on the story abstract; however, they must be
            subscribed in order to read the full story profile and place a bid.
            (A story profile includes Synopsis and 10% of the script pages).
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            Apart from accepting a special non-disclosure upon payment. The
            platform keeps a record of producers who have accessed more
            information about your script that is open to the general public and
            these along with our carefully revised terms of use discourage abuse
            of the platform and theft.
