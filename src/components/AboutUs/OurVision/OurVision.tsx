      <Typography paragraph>
        Everyone is invited. At Albantsho, the bedrock of storytelling is the
        true representation of diverse people. By creating a tool that not only
        enhances stories but also ensures that they end up on the screen; We
        encourage the audience's access to meaningful entertainment as well as
        narratives of themselves in voices they recognize.

      <Typography paragraph>
        With growing global investment in motion pictures in Africa, a higher
        demand is been placed on authentic stories from diverse voices. The
        north star now points clearly that we must go beyond writing as personal
        ventures to implementing solutions that flatten the playing field for
        everyone with a story.

      <Typography paragraph>
        Albantsho is a movement, and weâ€™ve charged ourselves with finding bold
        new narratives of Africa by Africans while empowering the screenwriters
        dreaming them up. The objective for us is to deliver technology
        solutions across filmmaking touchpoints that transform the African film
        landscape to compete favorably with global contemporaries.
